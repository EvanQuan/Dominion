## History

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

The Debt cost is optional to make it more appealing to buy, especially for
cheaper cards. The Debt "cost" also does not actually modify the cost of the
card to maintain synergies with gainers or trash-for-benefit during any phase of
the game.

### v0.1.0

![v0.1.0][^v0.1.0]

The Coin cost of a Borrowed card is converted to that amount of Debt + 2.
For example, Borrowed [Fortune][^Fortune] would cost 18 Debt, Borrowed
[Engineer][^Engineer] would cost 4 Debt, and Borrowed [Village][^Village] if a
card costs 5 Debt.
