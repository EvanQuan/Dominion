# Sacrifice

## Strategy

Comparable to [Desperation][^1], but for VP. Initially nets 1VP, but at the
cost of a Curse. As this provides no other resource except VP, the main
case to buy this would be either be in the ultra-late game to squeeze out
any possible VP where you don't expect to reshuffle your deck, or if you have
an engine that can reliably trash the Curse.

## History

### v0.2

Initially netting 0 VP is way too slow.
