# Charge

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

## History

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Changed to be more like [Cavalry][^Cavalry] for both flavour and as a slight
nerf.

### v0.1.0

![v0.1.0][^v0.1.0]

Weaker than [Villa][^Villa] in that it does not provide **+1 Coin**, does not
gain you a Village to your deck, and is limited to be used once per turn.
However, this is not limited to 10 Kingdom cards. Considering the power-level of Villa, this still seems playable.
