# Charge

![v0.1.0][^v0.1.0]

[^v0.1.0]: /Images/Charge_v0.1.0.png

Weaker than [Villa][^Villa] in that it does not provide **+1 Coin**, does not
gain you a Village to your deck, and is limited to be used once per turn.
However, this is not limited to 10 Kingdom cards. Considering the power-level of Villa, this still seems playable.
