# Grave Robbery

![v0.1.1](/Images/Grave_Robbery_v0.1.1.png)

## Strategy

Allows for consistent buys from the trash at a discount. Synergizes with
means to trash desirable cards, such as [Lurker][^Lurker] or
[Bandit][^Bandit].

Was confusing whether the "buy" in the description required an additional
**Buy**.

The "not less than 0 Coins" clause is unnecessary since this is always the
case for cost reducers.
