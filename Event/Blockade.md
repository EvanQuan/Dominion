## FAQ

- Cards can that belong to the Supply pile that has the Blockade token can
still be gained from other locations such as the trash.
- The Blockade token can be moved to an empty Supply pile.

## Strategy

Thematically similar to [Embargo][^1], but switches focuses between singular
Supply piles. The Blockade token can be moved to any Supply pile, meaning
Provinces or Golds can be blocked from being gained.
