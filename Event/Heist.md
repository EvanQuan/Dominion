## History

### v0.4.0

![v0.4.0][^v0.4.0]

More interesting.

### v0.3.0

![v0.3.0][^v0.3.0]

Can no longer be bought on turns 1 or 2. Competes with Gold.

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Was too powerful to buy on both turns 1 and 2.

Now is still stronger than Silver in the early-game, and potentially better
than Silver in some engines later on, which is reasonable considering the
price increase.
