## FAQ

- To use the Smuggling Ring event, you must create a Smuggling Ring deck
before starting the game. The Smuggling Ring deck is made up of Kingdom cards
that are not in the Supply of the current game. The players should agree
before the game which cards will be used to create the Smuggling Ring deck
(for example, you could agree to use one of every Kingdom card you own that
is not part of the Supply).
- It is recommended that the Smuggling Ring deck contains at least 15 Kingdom
cards with no duplicates.
- All players can see which cards are placed in the Smuggling Ring deck
before the game begins.
- Take one of each selected Kingdom card, shuffle them together, and place
the deck face down on the table where all players can reach it.
- This deck is not a Supply pile and if it is emptied, it does not count
towards the end game conditions.
- Only one Knight may be placed in the Smuggling Ring deck.
- It is not necessary to include *every* unused Kingdom card; you may decide
how many cards to include in the Smuggling Ring deck, and which ones, in any
way.
- If you buy a card from the Smuggling Ring deck and then use
[Trader][^Trader] to prevent yourself from gaining it, the bought card goes
back *on top* of the Smuggling Ring deck.

## History

### v0.1.0

![v0.1.0][^v0.1.0]

Changed to an event. Constantly revealing Smuggling Ring deck cards every buy
phase can slow the game down, especially when every player has it. Having to
pay to reveal Smuggling Ring cards makes it more "special" when it happens
and adds an extra level of decision making during the Buy phase.
