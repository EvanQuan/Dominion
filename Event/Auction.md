## FAQ

- It is recommended that the Auction deck contain at least 15 Kingdom cards,
with no duplicates.
- All players can see which cards are placed in the Auction deck before the
game begins.
- This deck is not a Supply pile and if it is emptied, it does not count
towards the end game conditions.

## History

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Unconditionally providing **+1 Buy** meant that all the Auction cards could
be purchased on turn 1. While there is not necessarily anything game-breaking
about this, it would make the game very un-fun due to the difficulty paying
off all the debt so early on.

Not providing the **+1 Buy** at all would heavily disincentive the player who
buys Auction to give up the bid, as they would lose their buy and give
another player a card.

By limiting Auction buys to one a turn, if the buying player fails to win the Auction, they lose their chance to win an Auction until another turn, even with multiple **+Buys**.
