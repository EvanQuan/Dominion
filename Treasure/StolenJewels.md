# Stolen Jewels

![v0.3][^4]

## History

### v0.3

![v0.3][^4]

Buying a single card on a turn, this is on par with or somewhat subpar with
other 4 Coin costed treasures. Getting multiple buys from this, especially
from its own Spoils from previous turns, can accelerate the number of Spoils
gained.

### v0.2

![v0.2][^3]

Gaining a Spoils is roughly valued at 1 Coin. Paying 4 Coins for a Copper is
terrible. Reducing the price to 0 Coins for a more interesting Copper is also
terrible.

Gaining a Spoils on gain and trash makes it a bit faster, and adds some
interaction with gainers and trashers.

### v0.1

![v0.1][^1]

Comparable to [Marauder][^2]. Does not give Ruins, but also does not cost an
Action to play.
