## History

### v0.4.0

![v0.4.0][^v0.4.0]

### v0.3.0

![v0.3.0][^v0.3.0]

Buying a single card on a turn, this is on par with or somewhat subpar with
other 4 Coin costed treasures. Getting multiple buys from this, especially
from its own Spoils from previous turns, can accelerate the number of Spoils
gained.

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Gaining a Spoils is roughly valued at 1 Coin. Paying 4 Coins for a Copper is
terrible. Reducing the price to 0 Coins for a more interesting Copper is also
terrible.

Gaining a Spoils on gain and trash makes it a bit faster, and adds some
interaction with gainers and trashers.

### v0.1.0

![v0.1.0][^v0.1.0]

Comparable to [Marauder][^Marauder]. Does not give Ruins, but also does not
cost an Action to play.
