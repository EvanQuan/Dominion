# Threat

Threats are a [landscape][^Landscape] that affect players if a condition is
not met over the course of a number of turns.

Threats are not [Kingdom][^Kingdom] cards, and cannot be bought. Including
one or more Ways in a game does not count toward the 10 Kingdom card piles
the [Supply][^Supply] includes. In fact, Threats are not considered "cards"
at all; any text referring to a "card" (such as instructions to "name a
card") does not apply to Threats. However, for references, Threats' effects
are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with black frames.
