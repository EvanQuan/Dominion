# Weather

Weather are effects that apply to all players for a single turn.

Weather are not Kingdom cards; including one or more in a game does not count
toward the 10 Kingdom card piles the supply includes. In fact, Weather are not considered "cards" at all; any text referring to a "card" (such as instructions to "name a card") does not apply to Weather. However, for reference, Weather effects are printed on cards in bright orange frames.

During setup, optionally choose any number of Weathers to include in a
Weather deck and shuffle them. Then include [Calm][^Calm] and place it on the
top of the Weather deck. At the start of each round of turns, reveal the top
Weather. For that round of the turns, each player is affected by the Weather
effect on their turn. At the start of the next round of turns, that Weather
is discarded and the next Weather is revealed. When the Weather pile is
discarded, the discarded Weathers are reshuffled.
