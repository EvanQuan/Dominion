# Shared Draft

## Setup

1. Randomly pick [Player Count * 6] Kingdom randomizers.
2. Randomly divide the select randomizers into [Player Count] number of
piles, giving one pile to each player.

## Draft Phase

1. Each player picks one randomizer from their pile and sets it aside (either
publically or privately, as long as it is consistent amongst all players).
2. Each player passes their pile to their left.
3. Repeat until each player has 6 randomizers set aside.
4. Each player picks a randomizer from a player on their left to move to the
centre to be shared.
5. Replace all randomizers with their respective Supply piles.

## Rules

For each player, "The Supply" is considered the shared Supply piles and their
own private 5-pile Kingdom, as normal.

This means players can only buy from their own Supply, or choose cards from
it when using gainers both targeted (ex. [Workshop][^5]) or general
(ex. [Populate][^4]) or targeted Supply trashers (ex. [Lurker][^6]).

However, players can indirectly acquire cards from other players' private
Supply piles with cards that directly refer to other cards, or move cards
between players. For example:

- [Masquerade][^1]
- [Smugglers][^2]
- [Jester][^3]
- Gaining cards from the trash
  - [Lurker][^6]
  - [Graverobber][^7]

## Additions/Variants

### Landscape Cards

1. Create a pile of mixed [Player Count + 2] Events, Landmarks, Ways, and
Projects, given to a random player.
2. That player picks a Landscape card to discard from the pile.
3. Once every player has had a chance to discard a card, the remaining 2 are
used by everyone.

### More Shared Piles

Increase the number of share piles above 1.

This should make games more balanced to reduce certain game-breaking interactions
possible by restricting certain cards like [Fool's Gold][^8], or [Knights][^9].

## FAQ

1. All base cards are shared (ex. Coppers, Provinces, Curses, Ruins, etc).
2. Three-pile endings occur if any given player's Kingdom (shared + private)
has 3 empty piles.
    - For example, if there is 1 empty shared pile, then one players needs 2
    empty private piles for a three-pile ending, independent of how many
    total empty piles there are in other players' private kingdoms.
