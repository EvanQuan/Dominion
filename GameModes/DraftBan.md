# Draft Ban

## Setup

Add 2 ban tokens for each player.

Choose a player to ban first. In clockwise order, each player chooses a
Kingdom Supply pile to ban for the player to their left by placing that
player's ban token on a Kingdom Supply pile. Once the last player has chosen
their left player's ban pile, the last person then chooses a second ban pile
for the player to their right. Continue counter-clockwise until all players
have selected their second ban pile.

Once a player has banned a pile, no other player may choose that pile to ban,
even if for a different player.

For example:

In a 3-player game, there are players A, B and C.

1. A bans a card for B by placing a B ban token on a Kingom supply pile.
2. B bans a card for C.
3. C bans a card for A.
4. C bans a card for B.
5. B bans a card for A.
6. A bans a card for C.
