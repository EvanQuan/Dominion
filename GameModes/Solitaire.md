# Solitaire

## Setup

### Easy Difficulty

Setup the Supply with 12 Victory cards of each type and 20 Curses (as if
playing with 3-4 players).

### Medium or Hard Difficulty

Setup the Supply with 8 Estates and 12 Victory cards of each other type
and 10 Curses.

## Rules

The opponent does not have a hand, or any cards starting in their deck and
cannot draws cards.

If a card in the opponent's deck is trashed, it is placed onto their deck.

The opponent goes first.

Every turn, the opponent gains the cheapest possible basic Victory card for
free (Estate, then Duchy, then Province) and places it facedown onto their
deck. This counts as a gain, in case there are cards that react to gains,
such as [Black Cat][^Black Cat] or [Road Network][^Road Network].

Whenever a basic Victory supply pile empties, the player immediately gains a
Curse.

**If on Hard difficulty, the player gains 2 Curses instead.**
