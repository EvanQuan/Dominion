## FAQ

- You cannot gain Victory cards if they are not the topmost card of that
pile. For example, if you play [Count][^Count] and choose "gain a Duchy"
while the topmost card of the Duchy Supply pile is a Ruins, you do not gain a
Duchy.
- The Ruins added the Victory Supply pile do not count towards the Ruins
count in the Ruins Supply pile, if there are any.
