# Rubble

![v0.1.1][^v0.1.1]

Makes trashing Victory cards more appealing, but not always preferable.

## Strategy

- Estates do not lose any VP when trashed, making trashing Estates even more
appealing to trash.

## FAQ

- Alternative Victory cards that provide a dynamic amount of VP provide VP
based on the point in time the card is trashed. This may require looking into
your deck or discard piles. If looking into your deck, shuffle it afterwards.
