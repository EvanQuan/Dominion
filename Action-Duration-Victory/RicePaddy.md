## History

### v0.3.0

![v0.3.0][^v0.3.0]

VP gain was too strong with certain gainers, such as Horse-gainers. It also
too strongly punished trashing attacks.

Now provides utility with Villager gains, on top of VP gains.

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Requires some amount of investment (Actions over multiple turns) to balance
out to a Dutchy unless deliberately built around. Should cost a most 5 Coins.
