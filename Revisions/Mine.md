Making Mine non-terminal can help make it less burdening in existing decks
with terminal Actions. This favours engine decks which may use this for
Copper trashing.

Strengthening the effect might make the card too different than the original
design, which might be better to make an alterate card for instead.

Lowering the cost to **4 Coins** might make it compete too favourably with
[Moneylender][^Moneylender]. More importantly, this heavily favours Big Money
strategies as it can be bought with Silver on a 3/4 or 4/3 opening split.
