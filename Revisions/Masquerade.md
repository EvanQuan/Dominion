While not officially considered an attack card, Masquerade is generally
considered as one because of how disruptive it can be to other players. As a
very powerful card at such a low price, it can very easily dominate games,
especially since it can be bought on turns 1 and 2. Increasing the cost and
scaling the card draw delays how early it can be acquired and impact the
game, while still keeping it powerful.
