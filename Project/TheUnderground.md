## FAQ

- To use The Underground Kingdom card, you must create an Underground deck
before starting the game. The Underground deck is made up of Kingdom cards
that are not in the Supply of the current game. The players should agree
before the game which cards will be used to create the Underground deck (for
example, you could agree to use one of every Kingdom card you own that is not
part of the Supply).
- It is recommended that the Underground deck contains at least 15 Kingdom
cards with no duplicates.
- All players can see which cards are placed in the Underground deck before
the game begins.
- Take one of each selected Kingdom card, shuffle them together, and place
the deck face down on the table where all players can reach it.
- This deck is not a Supply pile and if it is emptied, it does not count
towards the end game conditions.
- Only one Knight may be placed in the Underground deck.
- It is not necessary to include *every* unused Kingdom card; you may decide
how many cards to include in the Underground deck, and which ones, in any
way.
- If you buy a card from the Underground deck and then use [Trader][^Trader]
to prevent yourself from gaining it, the bought card goes back *on top* of
the Underground deck.
