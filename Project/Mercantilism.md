## History

### v0.3.0

![v0.3.0][^v0.3.0]

Was too Kingdom-dependant, while consistently helping Big Money.

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Now synergies with gainers.

Gaining cards through in the Action phase, such as through gainers benefit
from the cost reduction.

### v0.1.0

![v0.1.0][^v0.1.0]

Makes buying Provinces easier, while preventing synergy with multiple
**+Buys**. Works well with Big Money, which usually does not have additional
**+Buys**, although with a cost of $8, it might be better to just buy a
Province over this.

Ignores all **+Buys** you already have on the same turn you buy
Mercantilism, as well as **+Buys** gained on future turns.
