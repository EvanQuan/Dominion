## FAQ

- Additional cards that are gained in a turn are not received and remain
where they are. Whatever triggered the gain still can resolve (such as
playing an Action, or completing a Buy).

## Strategy

Makes buying Provinces easier, while preventing synergy with multiple
**+Buys**. Works well with Big Money, which usually does not have additional
**+Buys**, although with a cost of $8, it might be better to just buy a
Province over this.

Gaining cards through in the Action phase, such as through gainers will prevent you from gaining any cards in the Buy phase.

### Synergies

- Non-card gaining Events.

### Anti-synergies

- Gainers
- +Buys
