# Exchange

Exchanges are a [landscape][^Landscape] that provide alternate ways to buy
[Action][^Action] cards. When you buy an Action card, instead of paying the
cost printed on the Action card, you may do what is printed on an Exchange
being used in that game.

Exchanges are not [Kingdom][^Kingdom] cards, and cannot be bought. Including
one or more Ways in a game does not count toward the 10 Kingdom card piles
the [Supply][^Supply] includes. In fact, Exchanges are not considered "cards"
at all; any text referring to a "card" (such as instructions to "name a
card") does not apply to Exchanges. However, for references, Exchanges'
effects are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with light green
frames.
