## History

### v0.4.0

![v0.4.0][^v0.4.0]

Explicit "on your turn" no longer necessary due to Quest mechanic change.

Changed to Gain to be easier to accomplish when **+Buy** is not available.

### v0.3.0

![v0.3.0][^v0.3.0]

Returning Curses made no sense with the theme.
Gaining Victory cards was too powerful.

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Reward was too weak for such a large investment.

### v0.1.0
