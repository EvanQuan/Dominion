# Quest

Quests are effects that give additional means to gain cards or effects other
than through the normal use of cards or [Events][^Event]. Players can fulfill
the requirements of the Quest to receive the rewards.

Quests are not Kingdom cards; including one or more Quests in a game does not
count toward the 10 Kingdom card piles the supply includes. In fact Quests
are not considered "cards" at all; any text referring to a "card" (such as
instructions to "name a card") does not apply to Quests. However, for
reference, Quest effects are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with
light purple frames.

Quest progression and completion can only occur for each player on their own
turns.
