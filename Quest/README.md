# Quest

Quests are effects that give additional means to gain cards or effects other
than through the normal use of cards or [Events][^Event]. attached to cards.
Players can fulfill the requirements of the Quest to receive the rewards.

Quests are not Kingdom cards. In fact Quests are not considered "cards" at
all; any text referring to a "card" (such as instructions to "name a card",
or cost reducers changing the cost of cards) does not apply to Quests.
However, for reference, Quest effects are printed on cards in a landscape
orientation with light purple frames.

Quest progression and completion can only occur for each player on their own
turns.
