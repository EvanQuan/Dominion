# Lock

To **lock** a pile from a player is to prevent cards from a pile from being
removed from said player. This means that the player cannot buy, gain, Exile,
or otherwise remove cards from the locked pile. However, the player may still
interact with cards that belong to that pile in other locations such as those
already in their deck, in the trash, or from other players' decks. The player
may also return cards to the locked pile.

To **unlock** a pile for a player is to remove the lock from that pile for
said player.
