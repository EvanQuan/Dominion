Worshippers are the supply of tokens a player has on their Worshippers mat,
which can be spent during their Clean-up phase to trash a card they have in
player or from their hand for each token removed. Worshippers are represented
by [Coin tokens][^Coin token], which are also used by [Coffers][^Coffers],
[Villigers][^Villagers], [Pirate Ship][^Pirate Ship],
[Trade Route][^Trade Route], and [Sinister Plot][^Sinister Plot].
