## History

### v0.2.0

![v0.2.0][^v0.2.0]

Stating the card cannot be trashed or Exiled can confuse its interaction with
trashers. Can the card not get targeted? Does it get targeted but nothing
happens?

This makes the behaviour easier to understand as it can be compared to
[Fortress][^Fortress]. Putting the card onto your deck is also more
punishing, as it replaces a future card draw.
