# Law

Laws are effects that add additional rules for all players to followw.

Laws are not Kingdom cards; including one or more Laws in a game does not
count toward the 10 Kingdom card piles the supply includes. In fact Laws are
not considered "cards" at all; any text referring to a "card" (such as
instructions to "name a card") does not apply to Laws. However, for
reference, Law effects are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with
light orange frames.
