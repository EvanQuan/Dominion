# Law

Laws are effects that add additional rules for all players to followw.

Laws are not Kingdom cards. In fact Laws are not considered "cards" at
all; any text referring to a "card" (such as instructions to "name a card",
or cost reducers changing the cost of cards) does not apply to Laws.
However, for reference, Law effects are printed on cards in a landscape
orientation with Light orange frames.
